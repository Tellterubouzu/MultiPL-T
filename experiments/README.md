#### NOTE

The 15b experiments have been ran with DeepSpeed and using the following repository: https://github.com/cassanof/bigcode-finetuning-harness
The DeepSpeed configuration given won't change the results, but it will make the training faster.
For all results, we have used the `deepspeed_z3_config_bf16.json` configuration file in the repository above.
